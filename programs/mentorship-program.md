# AWS User Group Mentorship Program

## Introduction

The Accountability Buddies Program and the Mentorship Program serve similar goals of fostering growth and connection within the AWS User Group community, but they differ in structure, purpose, and outcomes. Here are the key differences:

## Mentorship Program:

- **Experienced Guidance:** Pairs consist of a mentor (experienced) and a mentee (less experienced), with the mentor providing knowledge, advice, and support.
- **Skill Development:** Focuses on professional development, skill enhancement, and career advice, with tailored objectives set based on the mentee's needs.
- **Formal Relationship:** More structured, with a clear dynamic of guidance and support from the mentor to the mentee.

## Objectives

Aims to provide targeted mentorship in specific areas like career development, technical skills, or soft skills.
Focuses on leveraging the mentorâ€™s expertise to navigate challenges and opportunities.
Could help someone who is aiming for a management position or a leadershio position to start with something small, and get experience on how to lead and share information.

## Interaction Dynamics

Features a more hierarchical dynamic where the mentor takes a guiding role, offering insights and feedback based on their experiences.
Check-ins can be more structured, with discussions centered around the mentee's growth and challenges.

## Commitment and Expectations

Involves a deeper commitment from both mentor and mentee, with expectations for guidance and proactive support from the mentor.
Meetings may require preparation, with mentors often providing resources or frameworks for discussion.
In summary, while both programs aim to enhance personal and professional development, the Accountability Buddies Program is more about peer support and accountability, while the Mentorship Program focuses on guidance and skill development from experienced individuals - provides valuable insighs and experience for someone aiming to be a better leader and a skillful communicator.
Last but not least, it can provide a meaningful and fulfilling experience for those who never led a team or someone to a specific goal.
